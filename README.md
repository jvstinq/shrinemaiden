THE BOT'S TOKEN HAS BEEN CHANGED PRIOR TO POSTING THIS. (So don't worry about a token being there lol)

Just as an FYI, this is an ongoing project I've never really finished. 

However, this includes simple commands for my discord bot I made in my server, and it's enough with slash commands to grant me the active discord developer badge, not much to take pride of, but it's nice.
